### 2. TESTING ENVIRONMENT AND FIRST CODE:
A/ What is .NET FRAMEWORK ?

The .NET Framework is a proprietary software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.
It was the predominant implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure until being superseded by the cross-platform .NET project. 
NET Framework is used to build and run apps on Windows. NET Framework is part of the . NET platform, a collection of technologies for building apps for Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and more.


B/ What is .NET CORE ?
.NET is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.
It is a cross-platform successor to .NET Framework.
The project is primarily developed by Microsoft employees by way of the .NET Foundation, and released under the MIT License.

### RUN C# PROGRAM IN .NET ENV:
ON lINUX or MAC: open a terminal inside VSCode
```
$ mcs <your_program_name>.cs
$ mono <oyur_program_name>.exe
```
On WINDOWS: Inside VS IDE - Press F5 or CTRL+F5 or Debug mode

Or open a Shell 
```
csc Your_File_name.cs
Your_File_name.exe
```

### Weekly assignment:
#### Assignment 1: 
Make a guessing game , come up with any questions. Make users guess the answwe. the next round only come up if you passed the question.
Note: allow the code to use both upper and lower cases.

#### Assignment 2:
Objects and inheritance in C#

Make a program based on Getter_Setter_example.cs

This new assignment shouls have a new class called "Student" which takes in new values:
Student ID, email, phone

#### Assignment 3:
This assignemnt following the "file_example.cs"

#### Assigment 4: JuliaListBox
##### Window form --GUI:
<i>Unfortunately, all of the IDEs for linux users are not fully support this feature. You can use an external VM or try with other OS instead . Or you can try with [cross-platform development using .NET on Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/blog/creating-cross-platform-applications-with-net-on-ubuntu-on-wsl)</i>

Description: Get to learn on how to create the 1st GUI using C# and .NET.
